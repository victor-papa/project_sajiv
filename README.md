## LAYING THE DRAW: SOME ANALYSIS
on collecting, preparing, and analysing data from a sports betting platform

Beating the bookies is an exciting idea living in many minds. This project originates from that idea, but also serves as the closure of my personal study semester. The last four months of 2020 I have invested in improving my understanding and skills in topics as statistical learning, prediction, and quantitative risk management. The goal of this project is to apply some of those skills to investigate the profitability of a certain betting strategy on football games, which has been at the back of my mind for a couple of years now. Look before you leap. And get some practical coding and analysis experience on the go.
